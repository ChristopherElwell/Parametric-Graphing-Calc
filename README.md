Renders a torus by default, though can be extended to any parametric surface. 
Utilizes 3D rotation matricies to rotate the latice. 
Uses numerical differentiation to determine optimal spacing of latice points in both dimensions to ensure triangles aren't too stretched (equilateral triangles are considered ideal).
Developed as a teaching tool for myself while teaching myself Python.
